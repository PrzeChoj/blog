This is a story of brothers named Adam and Przemo. Adam is a Data Science engineer with a master's in Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, Przemo is a PhD student in theoretical Maths.

Adam's interested in practical aspects of Math, while Przemo finds joy in theory.

Przemo always wanted to make math more user-friendly, while Adam had a unique skill in seeing the similarities.

Adam is a huge fan of Data, statistics, and practical probability. Przemo is a theoretic freak.

The point of this blog is not to convince You of anything. Nor is it to show the skill. Its purpose is not to inspire nor educate.

The point of this blog is to write sth that interests Adam and/or Przemo. To find better motivation to learn sth.

This being said, Adam and Przemo will write as though this was supposed to inspire, educate, and convince the reader of the superiority of Math superiority.

The posts will be about the Math behind the widely interpreted Data Science.

Any constructive feedback is highly appreciated.

Have an interesting day.

Adam, Przemys≈Çaw Chojecki

PS. Do you lean more toward practical applications like Adam or find joy in theory like Przemo? Or perhaps you see value in both?
